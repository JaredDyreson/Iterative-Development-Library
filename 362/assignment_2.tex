\section{Chapter 4 | Software Process and Project Metrics}

\begin{itemize}
\item estimation of time of completion and quality of work
\item quantitative
\item pin point problems
\item analyzed by software managers and collected by SWEs
\item past data helps us in the future
\item \textbf{Four Reasons}
\begin{itemize}
\item characterize
\item evaluate
\item predict
\item improve
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4.1}

\textbf{TL;DR : Make sure you're on track to publish}

\begin{itemize}
\item measurement occurs  as the result of the collection of one or more data points
\item \emph{indicator}: metric or combination metrics that provide insight into the SW process
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{4.2}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Project Indicators} enable a SW Project Manager to
\begin{itemize}
\item assess the status of an ongoing project
\item track potential risks
\item uncover problem areas before they go \emph{critical}
\item adjust work flow or tasks
\item evaluate the project team's ability to control quality of software work products
\end{itemize}
\item lots of factors influence development (time, resources, customers)
\item outcomes manifest in several forms (effort, money, scheduling)
\item \emph{PSP | Personal Software Process} helps evaluate engineers performance and can help improve (private metrics)
\item \emph{Public Metrics: }once private now open (project level defect rates, calendar times, etc)
\item 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{4.3 | Failure Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item All errors and defects are categorized by origin
\item The cost to correct each error and defect is recorded
\item The number of errors and defects in each category is counted and ranked in descending order
\item The overall cost of errors and defects in each category is computed
\item Resultant data is analyzed to uncover the categories that result in highest cost to the organization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4.5 | Metrics for Quality}

\begin{itemize}
\item project managers make sure things don't get whack son
\item ensure that the code you write will be dynamic and agnostic of specific features that might depreciate quickly
\item programs that aren't maintainable are a waste, make sure that shit is airtight (called \emph{spoilage})
\item use DRE to make sure your codebase is good $\rightarrow \textrm{DRE} = \frac{E}{(E + D)}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapter 5 | Software Project Planning}

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item make sure you have a roadmap yo
\item think about the present and the future
\item past experience also contributes to ease of development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Observations on Estimating}

\begin{itemize}
\item good project managers make sure problems are addressed before they even happen
\item foresight is key
\item project complexity is subjective 
\item project size can change the accuracy and efficacy of estimates
\item "What can go wrong will go wrong" | Murphy's Law
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Scope}

\begin{itemize}
\item what data is being manipulated and the stuff that does the manipulation
\item this is not clear initially but becomes clearer as the project continues on
\item make sure you and the client are on the same page, so it minimizes the confusion on expectations
\item ask meaningful questions to layout what exactly needs to be done
\item are the "demands" even reasonable?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure code you write is extensible
\item Ensure that project needs are addressed properly
\item Evaluate current technology to ensure delivery of product
\item Software is a huge component in project development
